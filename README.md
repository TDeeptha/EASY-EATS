# Food Reservation Application

## Project Overview

One of our team members encountered a significant challenge while accessing affordable and nutritious food near the university premises and their temporary living quarters. Recognizing that this struggle is shared by many students residing in nearby accommodations—where time constraints and limited food availability often hinder finding proper meals—we are developing an innovative solution to address these challenges effectively.

Our primary objective is to ensure consistent access to reasonably priced, high-quality, and healthy food options for students and others facing similar circumstances. Through the use of technology and community collaborations, we aim to create a platform/mobile app that connects local food providers with students, offering a diverse range of meal choices that meet specific dietary needs and preferences.

This solution not only addresses the immediate challenge of food accessibility but also promotes healthier eating habits among students, contributing to their overall well-being. Moreover, our project aligns with broader sustainability goals by encouraging local and sustainable food providers, reducing food waste, and supporting local businesses. By understanding the pain points and needs of our target users, and through strategic partnerships with local food suppliers near the university premises and students, we aim to create a sustainable ecosystem that will benefit both students and the community at large.
